***London Loot - Android App***

**Overview**

Concept:  
A hyper-local gig economy app where Londoners can find instant cash-paying micro-jobs or sell unused items/services in under 24 hours.  
 
Key Features & Money-Making Streams:  
1. Flash Tasks for Cash
- Users post or accept quick gigs (e.g., “Deliver a package across Camden,” “Queue for concert tickets,” “Help move furniture in Shoreditch”).  
- Payments released instantly via Open Banking/PayPal/Cash.  
 
2. Sell Your Stuff Fast
  - Snap a pic of an item (e.g., old phones, designer clothes, collectibles) and list it for same-day pickup with verified buyers.  
  - AI-powered instant price suggestions based on London resale markets (e.g., Depop, FB Marketplace).  
 
3. Rent Out Anything for Hours
  - Rent out tools, cameras, or even parking spaces by the hour (London parking is £££).  
 
4. Skill-Based Hustles
  - Offer quick services like:  
    - “Fix my bike in 30 mins” (for cyclists)  
    - “Help me write a CV” (for professionals)  
    - “Photograph my product” (for small businesses)  
 
5. Referral Cash
